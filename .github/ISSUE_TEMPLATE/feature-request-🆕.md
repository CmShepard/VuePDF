Explain here what you want `VuePDF` to have. (use english)

Some considerations before submit the issue:
* `VuePDF` is not a viewer per se, rather that is a component to make one.
* This library is mostly for display PDFs, editing features aren't supported and won't be it on the near future.
* Since `pdf.js` is the core library you can use its features directly without depends on `VuePDF` that only will use the most common features.
